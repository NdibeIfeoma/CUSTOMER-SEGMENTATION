## PROJECT OVERVIEW
The project aims to identify meaningful customer segments that will empower businesses to customize their offerings, improve customer engagement, and drive targeted marketing campaigns for more impactful results.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Understanding and successfully catering to the diverse needs of customers is vital. The Customer Segmentation project is to leverage advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to classify and group customers based on:
i.	Customer’s behaviour.
ii.	Customer’s preferences.
iii.	Characteristics of different customers.
Using these paramount details businesses can tailor their strategies to specific customer segments, optimizing marketing efforts, enhancing customer satisfaction, and ultimately maximizing overall business performance.
By incorporating machine learning algorithms, the system will analyze diverse data points to identify nuanced customer segments. This will enable businesses to tailor their products, services, and marketing strategies to specific customer needs, fostering stronger customer relationships and increasing overall business success.

## DATA SOURCE
-	Data was provided by 10Alytics.

## DATA CLEANING & PREPARATION
-	The Order ID had only 5 missing values out of 283,083. Since the company cannot find the data I recommend it's best to drop the data as the missing values are insignificant.

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
I carried out Exploratory Data Analysis and a series of data visualizations on the data.
-	Univariate Analysis
-	Bivariate Analysis
-	Multivariate Analysis

## RFM Analysis & Score
This method was used to classify the customers into different segments and gain more insights into the data.

## MACHINE LEARNING 
The techniques applied in this project include K-means & standard scaler, one hot encoding, DBSCAN, PCA Explained Variance Ratio and K-elbow method.
The model’s performance was evaluated. 

## FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
## - 35,398 are Loyal Customers: 
This set of customers made recent high-value purchases and are loyal to the business.
Maintain communication, provide loyalty rewards with exclusive discounts, and loyalty programs and offer incentives to increase spending.
Request feedback and involve them in the decision-making process to make them feel valued.
## - 27,968 are Champions: 
These are valuable customers who recently made high-value purchases frequently. 
Reward their loyalty, encourage continued engagement and offer exclusive deals.
## - 289 Customers at risk:  
Identify and address any issues or concerns these customers may have.
Provide exclusive offers or loyalty programs to retain their interest
## - 11 Lost Customers: 
Unfortunately, these customers are lost. They have been inactive for a long period.
Consider targeted win-back campaigns and surveys to understand the reasons for their departure. 
Use insights gained and incentives to improve customer satisfaction and retention strategies for 
other customers.
